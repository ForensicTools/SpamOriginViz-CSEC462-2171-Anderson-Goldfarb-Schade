The focus of the project will be to create software to analyze email and visualize it by sender ip and address, along with the amount of emails sent by that user. Mainly, the purpose for this would be to understand where significant volumes of spam are originating from so that network or security professionals can act accordingly, for example creating more refined filters, to reduce the volume of unwanted and unwarranted email traffic received. In order to create visual representations of the data we will use D3js Library.
