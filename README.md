# SpamOriginViz-CSEC462-2171-Anderson-Goldfarb-Schade
This project is by Michael Schade, Ben Goldfarb, and Brendon Anderson. The software will use the GPLv2 license. The focus of the project will be to create software to analyze email and visualize it by sender address. Mainly, the purpose for this would be to understand where significant volumes of spam are originating from so that network or security professionals can act accordingly, for example creating more refined filters, to reduce the volume of unwanted and unwarranted email traffic received. In order to create visual representations of the data we will most likely be using D3.JS, a Javascript library for manipulating and visualizing data.
